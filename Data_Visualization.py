        The graph shows a clear positive relationship between job level and monthly income. As job levels increase from 1 to 5, median income rises significantly. Lower job levels (1 and 2) have a more compact income distribution with less variability, while higher levels (3 to 5) show broader income ranges and higher pay. The trend highlights a structured salary progression, with stable but higher pay at senior job levels. There are a few outliers in lower levels, indicating some variation in income.
